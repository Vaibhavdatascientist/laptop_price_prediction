**Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning**
This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features and specifications using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about different laptop models, their configurations, and corresponding prices.

**Project Overview**
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict laptop prices based on their specifications.

**Key Tasks**

Data Exploration: Analyzed correlations between laptop features and prices.

Feature Engineering: Created new features like 'TouchScreen' and 'IPS Display'.

Preprocessing: Handled missing values, converted data types, and cleaned the dataset.

Model Building: Employed regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.

Model Evaluation: Assessed models using metrics like Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the Random Forest Regressor using GridSearchCV.
